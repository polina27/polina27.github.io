	<p>Before college, I majored in Visual Arts at a technical high school in Bergen County, NJ. Now, I humbly find myself studying Mechanical Engineering under a full scholarship at The Cooper Union in New York, NY.
 
<br><br>I'm graduating in May 2014 and will be working for a bridge engineering firm in New York called Hardesty &amp; Hanover starting in June.

			<h3>A new way to look back.<br><br></h3>
			<p>

				As a senior college (and a generally nostalgic person), I love to save and share my memories with friends. So I teamed up with two classmates and created this collaborative virtual scrapbook. hippocampus lets you share pictures, music, text, and more, all on customizable layouts that your friends can also view and edit with you. Click on the hippo to check out the first version of the website!
			<br><br>
			hippocampus was the product of my first Hackathon ever, hackCooper. (And it also won 3rd place!)</p>

		<div style="display:none" id="outreach"><h2>Outreach in NYC Public Schools</h2>
			<h3>
			Having role models in the field of STEM is a great way inspire interest in young students.
			<br><br></h3>
			<p>In 2012 and 2013, I helped Cooper Union receive the Diversity Action Grant from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). With this grant, a group of students and I were able to put together lesson plans, purchase materials, and lead a hands-on bridge building class for 5th graders from Brooklyn. Teaching kids about the engineering design process was a great experience, and something I hope to do again in the future.

			 <h3>@41CooperSquare is my senior design project. I am working with a fellow MechE, Janet Butler, and our project advisor, Professor Melody Baglione.

			<p>
			Driven by the goal of working with our building tenants to improve energy use, @41CooperSquare aims to share our building's energy performance with building tenants and visitors alike. By making this information accessible to the public, we hope to encourage green behaviors, inspire support for energy efficiency, and showcase some of the unique features of The Cooper Union.

		<div style="display:none" id="sweplanners"><h2>Society of Women Engineers (SWE) Planners</h2>
			<h3>
			 Creating an introduction to one of my favorite clubs at Cooper.
			 <br><br></h3>
			 <p>
			 I used Adobe InDesign to create monthly planners for the 2012-2013 school year, complete with the academic schedule, SWE events, and advice from the SWE board of officers. I also printed, cut, and spiral-bound the planners. The planners were very well received, and definitely added something special to our first meeting of that year.

		<div style="display:none" id="mechatronics"><h2>Mechatronics</h2>
			<h3>
			 Mechatronics was easily the coolest class I took in college. (Teams of students building robots to fight other robots... I mean, come on... So cool.)
			<br><br></h3>
			<p>My 3 teammates and I built this sumo robot "from scratch." That means we had to design the robot on paper and SolidWorks, plan out a budget and parts list, wire a breadboard, and program a microcontroller.
				<br><br>The robot had to stay in a 3' square "rink" and try to push an opponent robot out of the rink (like a sumo wrestler). Our robot didn't end up winning... but I gained programming experience and got to use hardware that I had never seen before.

			<h3>
			 One of my passions is bringing together people I love and respect in one place, at one time.
			 <br><br></h3>
			 <p>
			 In freshman year, my roommates and I decided that we wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving with all of our new freshman classmates before splitting up and heading home to celebrate with our families. So, we created a potluck event and told our friends to bring in a dish--everything except turkey, that is, because we didn't have functioning ovens in the freshman dorms. We titled this event "Everything But Turkey" (or EBT for short), and due to its overwhelming success, we turned it into a tradition. Every weekend before Thanksgiving, we gathered our best friends and best recipes and just enjoyed each other's company. By senior year, we had a new plan... we all had ovens and it was our last Thanksgiving together with our Cooper family. So, we decided we had to have one last EAT... Everything <b>AND</b> Turkey.
